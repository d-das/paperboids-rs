Hey there,
I ran into you last night at chicon st collective.
I couldn't find an email address and this was the only way I could think to get a hold of you.
Here is the project I was referring to:
http://cabbi.bo/enough/
Also, there are a bunch of really cool things on the main page
http://cabbi.bo/

Hope you find some inspiration from the site!
I definitely got some from your project.
Cheers,
Dawson
